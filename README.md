# Kiwibank Tool
An ugly interactive budgeting GUI for Kiwibank .csv statements. Mint.com doesn't work with New Zealand banks so I built my own personal poor man's version.

### Usage
* Run `main.py`
* Load statement csv by clicking `choose file` or `Ctrl + o`. Load more if you wish by right clicking `choose file` and selecting `Add Statement`
* Add budget categories and their amounts by clicking `+` 
* Drag transactions between categories to order budgets
* Collapse/expand categories by clicking the icon to the left of the category name
* Edit category amount by clicking the amount display
* Right clicking category name lets one remove a category or edit its name
* Cycle through months by clicking `<` or `>` by the month name
